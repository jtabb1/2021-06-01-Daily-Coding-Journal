    <p>Here is how I handled my plans yesterday:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Done:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spend at least 30 minutes working on stretch features of my 
            project,
            that have not been formally assigned yet.  These are important 
            features that I really really want to put in, but might not 
            actually make it in there due to time constraints.</li>
          <li>Spend at least 30 minutes evaluating features that will most 
            likely 
            actually make it to the final version of the project.</li>
          <li>Do the other errands that I need to do for my job and my 
            life today.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Not Done:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Null</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
